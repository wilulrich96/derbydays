			<h1>What is Derby Days?</h1>
			<p>Derby Days is a philanthropy event that every Chapter of Sigma Chi holds annually to raise money for the Huntsman Cancer Institute.  At Lehigh University, Derby Days occurs across one 
			of the last weeks of the Spring Semester, and has traditionally involved the Panhellenic sororities competing against one another in dancing and sporting events.  This year 
			we are excited that members of the Cultural Greek Council and Phi Sigma Kappa will be involved, and we are hoping that Derby Days can continue to become more inclusive in the future.
			</p>

			<h1>Philanthropy Goal</h1>
			<h4><a href="https://www.youcaring.com/christopheranddanareevesfoundation-807645"><u>Click here to donate and help us reach our goal of raising $10,000!</u></a></h4>
			<p>
			In the past, Sigma Chi has always donated the proceeds of Derby Days to the Huntsman Cancer Institution.  While we have great respect for the institution, we have decided that we want to donate the proceeds from this year’s events to the 
			<a href="https://www.christopherreeve.org/"><u>Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation</u></a>. We have made this decision because a member of our fraternity recently fell and suffered a serious spinal cord injury (SCI).  Fortunately, he is recovering well largely thanks to SCI research that was made possible by philanthropic organizations like the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Christopher Reeve, a famous actor who is best known for his portrayal of Superman, founded the foundation with Dana following his tragic equestrian accident that left him ventilator dependent and a quadriplegic.  Using Chris’ celebrity status, Dana and Chris were able to drastically increase SCI research and improve quality of life for those with significant spinal damage.   Unfortunately, Chris passed away in 2004, but his legacy carries on through the foundation and the research it funds.  The brothers of Sigma Chi are very impressed with the Christopher and Dana’s story and hope that Derby Days can help support the foundation’s positive impact on those suffering from spinal cord injuries.
			</p>
			
			<h1>Schedule of Events</h1>
			<h3>Dance Competiton - April 24th</h3>
			<p>
			The dance competiton will be held in PL 101 from 6:00-8:00pm.  Each sorority will perform a 3-5 minute dance routine that is graded based on difficulty, 
			execution, and uniformity.  The sorority with the highest overall score will win the event.  The complete score sheet can be seen <a href="DERBY DAYS DANCE SCORE SHEET.pdf"><u>here</u></a><!--style this better-->. We are excited to have members 
			of the Cultural Greek Council judge the event this year and appreciate their support.  As always, members of Sigma Chi will also perform a dance, but it will not be scored.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Field Day - April 26th</h3>
			<p>
			Field Day is a combination of the dodgeball and flag football competitions.  For both events, sororities will have teams of 8 woman compete against one another in an elimination style
			brackets to determine the winner.  We are excited this year to have members of Phi Sigma Kappa help referee both events.  Field Day will occur on the 
			intramural fields in front of Goodman Stadium from 4:30-7:00pm.
			We aren’t allowed to serve food, so please bring your own snacks.  Water will be provided at the event.
			</p>
			
			<h3>BBQ and Knockout - April 28th</h3>
			<p>
			Derby Days will conclude with a knockout tournament and BBQ at Sigma Chi from 4:30-6:00pm. Knockout will consist of 5 women from each sorority forming a team and competing against the other sororities in an elimination style bracket.  At the BBQ, we will celebrate the conclusion of another successful Derby Days and announce this year’s winner.  Hamburgers and hotdogs will be served at the event.
